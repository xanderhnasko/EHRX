His presenting symptom of bilateral joint pain in the knees and fingers paired with a positive RF, CCP, and decreased CD4 count made this diagnosis very likely. Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome is very heavily associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, estimated prevalence between 17-30% in those with previously diagnosed Rheumatoid Arthritis. The patient's laboratory and imaging studies, including a positive SS-A, neck CT showing chronic enlargement of the Parotid Gland, paired with the symptom of dry mouth and a burning sensation of the eye, a possible manifestation of dry eyes, are suggestive of Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome. Another possible cause of the burning sensation is trigeminal neuralgia, a neurological manifestation of Sjogren's syndrome. However, this patient also presents with some of rarer manifestations of Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome. According to UpToDate: Clinical manifestations of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease, normochromic normocytic anemia can be seen in up to 20% of sjogrens patients. Further, \u201cPatients with SS may exhibit abnormal counts in any cell line, and patients with cytopenia often have involvement of more than one cell line\u201d3. This hematologic manifestation of disease accounts for many of the abnormal blood tests including the anemia and leukopenia. This anemia could be the underlying cause of the lightheadedness and muscle weakness. Further, a more rare manifestation of Sj\u00f6grens Syndrome, is autonomic neuropathy3. Autonomic neuropathy manifests as headache, lightheadedness, early satiety, vomiting, weight loss, and sweating abnormalities. The patient's headaches with lightheadedness, as well as his GI symptoms and night sweats can be explained by the neurological manifestations of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Finally, autoimmune diseases are often associated with cutaneous manifestations. Some of these, such as the malar rash of lupus are well defined, while others are ill defined. The pre-auricular rash can be seen as an atypical cutaneous presentation of Sjogren's syndrome.",

The anemia and leukopenia can also be accounted for by SLE. However, SLE would not explain the dry mouth and burning eyes, nor would it explain the parotid gland involvement. However, the macular rash in the pre-auricular area, which the sister described as extending over the eyelids and bridge of the nose, does sound suspicious of the malar rash. However, at the time of physical exam, the rash was only seen in the pre-auricular area. The patient denies any photosensitivity. While SLE cannot be ruled out at this time, Sjogren's Syndrome accounts for a more global diagnosis of the patient's symptoms.",
